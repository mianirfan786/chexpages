          <u>Refunds</u>
        </PrivacyPolicyUnderLine>
        <PrivacyPolicyText>
          Chex.ai handles refund requests on a case by case basis. From time to time, Chex.ai may offer a refund for an inspection if, in its sole and absolute discretion, it
          determines that a refund is appropriate. Under no circumstances shall Chex.ai be obligated to provide a refund. You acknowledge that your vehicle may be rejected for
          non-compliance with certain standards, and that in such event, Chex.ai will have nevertheless expended effort and resources in providing the Services. Chex.ai cannot
          guarantee the suitability or compliance of every vehicle inspected, and therefore cannot guarantee a satisfactory result, despite your payment for the Services.

          <u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</u>
        </PrivacyPolicyUnderLine>
        <PrivacyPolicyText>
          These Terms of Use are entered into in the State of California and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California exclusive of
          its choice of law rules. Each party to these Terms of Use submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of California and
          waives any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. In the event that any of the Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of
          competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, those provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use shall otherwise
          remain in full force and effect.

          <u>Waiver and Severability</u>
        </PrivacyPolicyUnderLine>
        <PrivacyPolicyText>
          No waiver by Chex.ai of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any
          other term or condition, and any failure of Chex.ai to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        </PrivacyPolicyText>
        <PrivacyPolicyText>
          If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such
          provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

          These Terms of Use constitute an agreement that is effective unless and until terminated by Chex.ai. If in Chex.ai's sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or
          provision of these Terms of Use, Chex.ai may deny you access to the Sites. In the event of denial of access by Chex.ai, you are no longer authorized to access the Sites,
          and the restrictions imposed upon you with respect to material copied or downloaded, and the disclaimers and limitations of liabilities set forth in these Terms of Use,
          shall continue in force.
